# MovieSearchNetWorking
Week4 Assessment at DevMountain

## Instructions for MovieSearch
### Requirements
- Please watch the screen recording provided before starting. It demonstrates the application you are to create for this assessment.
- The documentation for the API you should use can be found at https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started (Links to an external site.). The documentation for this API is a little harder to navigate than what you might be used to so be sure to spend a sufficient amount of time going over the documentation to make sure you find the correct URL to use and that you can get sample JSON. You will also need to register for an API key if you do not have one already.
- You will have 3 hours and 30 minutes to complete this challenge.
- Your project must use Codable and follow these requirements:
1) Allow a user to search for a movie by name
2) Display search results either in a table view or collection view.
3) The results should show the movie title, rating, and summary.
4) Display the poster of each movie on your custom cell (Hint, the URL for fetching a movies image is: https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/(imageEndpoint) (Links to an external site.))

## Black Diamonds
1) Tapping on a movie shows a detail view with more information.
2) Allow marking a movie as a favorite.
3) Add a tab that shows all favorited movies.

 ## Covered Concepts
- To complete this challenge you will need to be familiar with the following from this unit:
1) Closures
2) Asynchronous calls
3) URLSession
4) Failable initializers
5) Parsing through the returned data in JSON format from network APIs
6) Working with network API documentation.
7) Intermediate UITableView concepts such as custom cells.
